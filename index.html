                        <p class="large-text">I am a developer who has been creating web projects for last 5 years. Born
                            and raised in Utah I grew up playing saxophone and ballroom dancing. Later I joined the
                            debate team and dabbled in some biotechnology through highschool and a year of college
                            before getting into programming and starting my career. </p>

                    <h5>What makes you nervous?</h5>
                    <p>Creepy crawlers make me itch - from spiders to snakes, but what really makes me nervous are
                        heights and being unprepared in front of a crowd. Learning to snowboard has been a really fun
                        because I get to fall down mountains in front of anyone on their way to the top.</p>

                    <h5>What has been your greatest moment as a developer?</h5>
                    <p>Fully capturing complex animations that really push my skills to the limit are some of the most
                        satisfying projects. One of the most complex projects I have worked on utilized GASP, Waypoints,
                        and custom animations to build a complex scroll-based <a

                    <h5>What is your favorite thing from pop culture?</h5>
                    <p>Lately, I have been really enjoying The Witcher on Netflix after having enjoyed the video game.
                        I need to read the books still, but my favorite book series of all is the Wheel of Time, which
                        recently got picked up by Amazon and started filming at the end of 2019, cant wait to see how it
                        turns out.</p>
